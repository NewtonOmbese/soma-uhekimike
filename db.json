However, collaboration on information-seeking tasks is actually commonplace. Students work together to complete homework assignments, friends seek information about joint entertainment opportunities, family members jointly plan vacation travel, and colleagues jointly conduct research for their projects. As improved networking technologies and the rise of social media simplify the process of remote collaboration, and large, novel display form-factors simplify the process of co-located group work, researchers have begun to explore ways to facilitate collaboration on search tasks. This lecture investigates the who, what, where, when and why of collaborative search, and gives insight in how emerging solutions can address collaborators' needs.

In the modern world system there appears to be no firm, unchallenged ground on which to construct a meaningful canopy. But around the world, many individuals and groups long for a kind of cultural coherence that they believe once existed. They search for fundamentals. While these may be sought in religious traditions, many also aspire to new secular certainties. In their various new forms and contexts the contemporary quests for meaning in turn transform the societies in which they occur. The rich comparative examples in The Search for Fundamentals are used to analyze the sources and consequences of several cultural movements. The book also offers theoretical reflections on the difficulties they experience and on the message they carry for students of modernity. Audience: A broad readership of scholars and advanced students in the social sciences and humanities.",

Evolutionary-based meta-heuristic approaches are increasingly being applied to solve complicated optimization problems in several real-world applications. One of the most successful optimization algorithms is the Cuckoo search (CS), which has become an active research area to solve N-dimensional and linear/nonlinear optimization problems using simple mathematical processes. CS has attracted the attention of various researchers, resulting in the emergence of numerous variants of the basic CS with enhanced performance since 2019.",

Java is an invaluable language to master, as it’s widely used for application development, including Android, desktop, and server-side applications. Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies is written specifically for newbies to programming. The book starts with an overview of computer programming and builds from there; it explains the software you need, walks you through writing your own programs, and introduces you to a few of the more-complex aspects of programming in Java. It also includes step-by-step examples you can try on your own (and email the author if you need help). As you work through the book, you’ll get smart about these Java features: Object-oriented programming (OOP), a Java mainstay IntelliJ IDEA, an integrated development environment (IDE), that gives you one place to do all your programming, including debugging code Loops, branches, and collections Variables and operators Expressions, statements, and blocks Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies translates all this foreign programming and computer syntax into plain English, along with plenty of helpful examples and tips. Learning a new language—and coding is definitely its own language—should be a fun endeavor. With this book as your handy interpreter, you’ll be on your way to fluency, speaking the language of coders everywhere!",

The third edition of Java Precisely provides a concise description of the Java programming language, version 8.0. It offers a quick reference for the reader who has already learned (or is learning) Java from a standard textbook and who wants to know the language in more detail. The book presents the entire Java programming language and essential parts of the class libraries: the collection classes, the input-output classes, the stream libraries and Java 8's facilities for parallel programming, and the functional interfaces used for that. Though written informally, the book describes the language in detail and offers many examples. For clarity, most of the general rules appear on left-hand pages with the relevant examples directly opposite on the right-hand pages. All examples are fragments of legal Java programs. The complete ready-to-run example programs are available on the book's website. This third edition adds material about functional parallel processing of arrays; default and static methods on interfaces; a brief description of the memory model and visibility across concurrent threads; lambda expressions, method reference expressions, and the related functional interfaces; and stream processing, including parallel programming and collectors.",

          "description": "The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements: The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a \"gotchas\" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate. Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming. Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications. Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.",

With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers. You’ll also discover how to access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. With code examples and step-by-step instructions, author Bonnie Eisenman shows web developers and frontend engineers how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. Along the way, you’ll build several increasingly sophisticated sample apps with React Native before putting everything together at the end. Learn how React Native provides an interface to native UI components Examine how the framework uses native components analogous to HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Install modules for APIs and features not supported by the framework Get tools for debugging your code, and for handling issues outside of JavaScript Put it all together with the Zebreto effective-memorization flashcard app Deploy apps to the iOS App Store and Google’s Play Store",

Node.js is a scalable application server that is used in thousands of websites, while GraphQL is becoming the standard way for large websites to provide data and services to their users. Together, these technologies, when reinforced with the capabilities of TypeScript, provide a cutting-edge stack for complete web application development. This book takes a hands-on approach to implementing modern web technologies and the associated methodologies for building full-stack apps. You’ll begin by gaining a strong understanding of TypeScript and how to use it to build high-quality web apps. The chapters that follow delve into client-side development with React using the new Hooks API and Redux. Next, you’ll get to grips with server-side development with Express, including authentication with Redis-based sessions and accessing databases with TypeORM. The book will then show you how to use Apollo GraphQL to build web services for your full-stack app. Later, you’ll learn how to build GraphQL schemas and integrate them with React using Hooks. Finally, you’ll focus on how to deploy your application onto an NGINX server using the AWS cloud. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to build and deploy complete high-performance web applications using React, Node, and GraphQL. What you will learnDiscover TypeScript’s most important features and how they can be used to improve code quality and maintainabilityUnderstand what React Hooks are and how to build React apps using themImplement state management for your React app using ReduxSet up an Express project with TypeScript and GraphQL from scratchBuild a fully functional online forum app using React and GraphQLAdd authentication to your web app using RedisSave and retrieve data from a Postgres database using TypeORMConfigure NGINX on the AWS cloud to deploy and serve your appsWho this book is for The book is for web developers who want to go beyond front-end web development and enter the world of full-stack web development by learning about modern web technologies and how they come together.

              "description": "React jsThe Complete Beginner's Guide to React - 2nd Edition (2020)Facebook's React has changed the way we think about web applications and user interface development. Due to its design, you can use it beyond web. A feature known as the Virtual DOM enables this.In this chapter we'll go through some of the basic ideas behind the library so you understand React a little better before moving on.What is React?React is a JavaScript library that forces you to think in terms of components. This model of thinking fits user interfaces well. Depending on your background it might feel alien at first. You will have to think very carefully about the concept of state and where it belongs.Because state management is a difficult problem, a variety of solutions have appeared. In this book, we'll start by managing state ourselves and then push it to a Flux implementation known as Alt. There are also implementations available for several other alternatives, such as Redux, MobX, and Cerebral.React is pragmatic in the sense that it contains a set of escape hatches. If the React model doesn't work for you, it is still possible to revert back to something lower level. For instance, there are hooks that can be used to wrap older logic that relies on the DOM. This breaks the abstraction and ties your code to a specific environment, but sometimes that's the pragmatic thing to do.One of the fundamental problems of programming is how to deal with state. Suppose you are developing a user interface and want to show the same data in multiple places. How do you make sure the data is consistent?Historically we have mixed the concerns of the DOM and state and tried to manage it there. React solves this problem in a different way. It introduced the concept of the Virtual DOM to the masses.Virtual DOM exists on top of the actual DOM, or some other render target. It solves the state manipulation problem in its own way. Whenever changes are made to it, it figures out the best way to batch the changes to the underlying DOM structure. It is able to propagate changes across its virtual tree as in the image above.Virtual DOM PerformanceHandling the DOM manipulation this way can lead to increased performance. Manipulating the DOM by hand tends to be inefficient and is hard to optimize. By leaving the problem of DOM manipulation to a good implementation, you can save a lot of time and effort.React allows you to tune performance further by implementing hooks to adjust the way the virtual tree is updated. Though this is often an optional step.The biggest cost of Virtual DOM is that the implementation makes React quite big. You can expect the bundle sizes of small applications to be around 150-200 kB minified, React included. gzipping will help, but it's still big.",

Knowledge of basic JavaScript will give you a good head start with the book. What You Will Learn Understand the ReactJS basics through an overview Install and create your first React component Refactor the ReactJS component using JSX Integrate your React application with the Facebook login and Graph API, then fetch data from your liked pages in Facebook and display them in a browser Handle UI elements events with React, respond to users input, and create stateful components Use some core lifecycle events for integration and find out about ES6 syntaxes in the React world Understand the FLUX architecture and create an application using FLUX with React Make a component more reusable with mixins and validation helpers and structure your components properly Explore techniques to test your ReactJS code Deploy your code using webpack and Gulp In Detail ReactJS, popularly known as the V (view) of the MVC architecture, was developed by the Facebook and Instagram developers. It follows a unidirectional data flow, virtual DOM, and DOM difference that are generously leveraged in order to increase the performance of the UI. Getting Started with React will help you implement the Reactive paradigm to build stateless and asynchronous apps with React. We will begin with an overview of ReactJS and its evolution over the years, followed by building a simple React component. We will then build the same react component with JSX syntax to demystify its usage. You will see how to configure the Facebook Graph API, get your likes list, and render it using React. Following this, we will break the UI into components and you'll learn how to establish communication between them and respond to users input/events in order to have the UI reflect their state. You'll also get to grips with the ES6 syntaxes. Moving ahead, we will delve into the FLUX and its architecture, which is used to build client-side web applications and complements React's composable view components by utilizing a unidirectional data flow. Towards the end, you'll find out how to make your components reusable, and test and deploy them into a production environment. Finally, we'll briefly touch on other topics such as React on the server side, Redux and some advanced concepts. Style and approach The book follows a step-by-step, practical, tutorial approach with examples that explain the key concepts of ReactJS. Each topic is sequentially explained and contextually placed to give sufficient details of ReactJS.",

Around the world, programmers appreciate Python for its simplicity, power, expressiveness, and the sheer pleasure of writing Python code. Python 3.1 is the newest and best version of the language yet: more convenient, more consistent, and easier to use. Mark Summerfield demonstrates how to write code that takes full advantage of the latest Python 3 features and idioms. Programming in Python 3, 2/e, brings together all the knowledge needed to write programs, use any library, and even create new library modules. The book teaches every aspect of the Python 3 language. It covers all the built-in functionality, as well as key components of Python's standard library. Structured so readers can write Python programs from chapter 1, each subsequent chapter provides further depth and broader coverage. Two new chapters have been added to this edition increasing the coverage to include parsing, debugging, testing, and profiling. Readers will master Python procedural and object-oriented techniques; creation of custom modules and packages; writing and reading files; multithreading; networking; database programming; GUIs; regular expressions; application debugging, testing, and profiling; and more. Detailed appendices include coverage of migrating applications from Python 2 to Python 3, plus a complete language reference. All sample code has been tested with the final version of Python 3 on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.",

DESCRIPTION This book is intended for the professional programmer who wants to learn Python for their place of business, or simply to extend their knowledge. You will learn the basics of the language--from how to define variables and implement looping and conditional constructs, to working with existing code. Once we have established the baseline for writing code in Python, you’ll learn how to create your own functions and classes, how to extend existing code, and how to work with Python-specific things like comprehensions and generators. With a solid foundation, you will then move on to learn about the existing Python libraries, called packages, and how to use them, as well as discovering little tips and tricks that will make you a hit with all the programmers at work, and really aid you in nailing that programming interview. KEY FEATURES Acquire knowledge of Python programming simply and easily. Learn about object-oriented programming and how it applies to Python. Make a splash with list comprehensions, generators, and decorators. Learn about file processing with Python, and how it makes JSON easy to deal with. Work with dictionaries and sets quickly and easily. Learn about what others have made available in the Python world. Pick up tricks and tips that will make you look like a Python expert in no time. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the time you have finished this book, you will know enough to write complex Python programs and work with existing Python code. You will find out about the packages that make Python one of the most popular programming languages and will understand the “Pythonic” way of thinking and programming. WHO THIS BOOK IS FOR This book is designed for programmers who have experience in at least one programming language. No prior Python experience is necessary, but it is assumed that you understand the basics of loops, conditionals and object-oriented constructs, such as classes. You should have or have access to a system that runs Python 3 (any version). Table of Contents 1. The history and installation of Python 2. Python types and constructs 3. The Nuts and Bolts 4. Structuring your Python projects 5. Object-oriented programming with Python 6. Advanced manipulations 7. File input and output 8. Imports and Exports 9. Miscellaneous 10.

What's the next step toward becoming a capable, confident software developer? Welcome to Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python. More than a mere collection of advanced syntax and masterful tips for writing clean code, you'll learn how to advance your Python programming skills by using the command line and other professional tools like code formatters, type checkers, linters, and version control. Sweigart takes you through best practices for setting up your development environment, naming variables, and improving readability, then tackles documentation, organization and performance measurement, as well as object-oriented design and the Big-O algorithm analysis commonly used in coding interviews. The skills you learn will boost your ability to program--not just in Python but in any language. You'll learn: • Coding style, and how to use Python's Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code • Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers • How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool • Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions • How to profile the speed of your code with Python's built-in timeit and cProfile modules • The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis • How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them • How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they're used to organize code Toward the end of the book you'll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book's best practices. You'll test your skills by implementing the program yourself. Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer, as you learn to write readable code that's easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic Requirements: Covers Python 3.6 and higher",

If you’ve previously worked in another programming language such as Java, C#, or Perl, you’ll probably pick up the concepts in the earlier chapters quickly; however, the book assumes no prior experience of programming or of building Web applications. That said, because PHP is primarily a Web technology, it will help if you have at least some knowledge of other Web technologies, particularly HTML and CSS. Many Web applications make use of a database to store data, and this book contains three chapters on working with MySQL databases. Once again, if you’re already familiar with databases in general — and MySQL in particular — you’ll be able to fly through these chapters. However, even if you’ve never touched a database before in your life, you should still be able to pick up a working knowledge by reading through these chapters.",

A particular focus is the use of PHP to generate MySQL commands from a script as it is executed. Each chapter includes aims, a summary and practical exercises (with solutions) to support learning. Chapters are designed to stand alone as far as possible, so that they can be studied independently of the rest of the text by those with some previous knowledge of the languages. There is a comprehensive glossary of technical terms, together with extensive appendices for quick reference of language features.",

Ruby 2.0 is less radical--it has keyword arguments, a new regexp engine, and some library changes. This book describes it all. The first quarter of the book is a tutorial introduction that gets you up to speed with the Ruby language and the most important classes and libraries. Download and play with the hundreds of code samples as your experiment with the language. The second section looks at real-world Ruby, covering the Ruby environment, how to package, document, and distribute code, and how to work with encodings. The third part of the book is more advanced. In it, you'll find a full description of the language, an explanation of duck typing, and a detailed description of the Ruby object model and metaprogramming. The book ends with a reference section: comprehensive and detailed documentation of Ruby's libraries. You'll find descriptions and examples of more than 1,300 methods in 58 built-in classes and modules, along with brief descriptions of 97 standard libraries. Ruby makes your programming more productive; it makes coding fun again. And this book will get you up to speed with the very latest Ruby, quickly and enjoyably.",

The actor's scripted words would prove prophetic. The film propelled her to stardom. Ruby Keeler's rags-to-riches story is told in this pictorial biography (with text as well). Born on August 25, 1910 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, her father an iceman, her family moved to New York City in 1912. Soon enrolled in the Professional Children's School, she got her first taste of life on the stage, eventually finding her way to Broadway. Her dancing brought her the pivotal role in 42nd Street and she was soon one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood. Her performance in No, No, Nanette in 1971, her first Broadway show in 41 years, met with rave reviews. Keeler's life, including her ill-fated marriage to performer Al Jolson, is recounted here, with many never-before-seen photographs.",

                    "description": "A New York Times bestseller and Oprah Book Club 2.0 selection, the epic, unforgettable story of a man determined to protect the woman he loves from the town desperate to destroy her. This beautiful and devastating debut heralds the arrival of a major new voice in fiction. Ephram Jennings has never forgotten the beautiful girl with the long braids running through the piney woods of Liberty, their small East Texas town. Young Ruby Bell, “the kind of pretty it hurt to look at,” has suffered beyond imagining, so as soon as she can, she flees suffocating Liberty for the bright pull of 1950s New York. Ruby quickly winds her way into the ripe center of the city—the darkened piano bars and hidden alleyways of the Village—all the while hoping for a glimpse of the red hair and green eyes of her mother. When a telegram from her cousin forces her to return home, thirty-year-old Ruby finds herself reliving the devastating violence of her girlhood. With the terrifying realization that she might not be strong enough to fight her way back out again, Ruby struggles to survive her memories of the town’s dark past. Meanwhile, Ephram must choose between loyalty to the sister who raised him and the chance for a life with the woman he has loved since he was a boy. Full of life, exquisitely written, and suffused with the pastoral beauty of the rural South, Ruby is a transcendent novel of passion and courage. This wondrous page-turner rushes through the red dust and gossip of Main Street, to the pit fire where men swill bootleg outside Bloom’s Juke, to Celia Jennings’s kitchen, where a cake is being made, yolk by yolk, that Ephram will use to try to begin again with Ruby. Utterly transfixing, with unforgettable characters, riveting suspense, and breathtaking, luminous prose, Ruby offers an unflinching portrait of man’s dark acts and the promise of the redemptive power of love. Ruby was a finalist for the PEN America Robert Bingham Debut Novel Award, a Barnes & Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, and an Indie Next Pick.",

Author Lauraine Snelling once again takes readers west to the untamed land of Dakota Territory, introducing new characters both unique and appealing. Ruby Torvald and her young sister, Opal, have received an inheritance from their long-lost father who left home years ago to seek his fortune in the Black Hills. When they leave their comfortable situation in Chicago and arrive at the mining town of Medora to claim their inheritance, the sisters discover that rather than the legacy of gold they expected, their father has left them a shocking bequest. Ruby's bold determination in the face of scandal leads the reader on a journey both heartwarming and inspiring.",

With standards-driven design, keeping style separate from content is not just a possibility but a reality. You no longer use HTML and XHTML as design tools, but strictly as ways to define the meaning and structure of web content. And Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are no longer just something interesting to tinker with, but a reliable method for handling all matters of presentation, from fonts and colors to page layout. When you follow the standards, both the site's design and underlying code are much cleaner. But how do you keep all those HTML and XHTML tags and CSS values straight? Jennifer Niederst-Robbins, the author of our definitive guide on standards-compliant design, Web Design in a Nutshell, offers you the perfect little guide when you need answers immediately: HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference. This revised and updated new edition takes the top 20% of vital reference information from her Nutshell book, augments it judiciously, cross-references everything, and organizes it according to the most common needs of web developers. The result is a handy book that offers the bare essentials on web standards in a small, concise format that you can use carry anywhere for quick reference. This guide will literally fit into your back pocket. Inside HTML and XHTML Pocket Reference, you'll find instantly accessible alphabetical listings of every element and attribute in the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Recommendations. This is an indispensable reference for any serious web designer, author, or programmer who needs a fast on-the-job resource when working with established web standards.",

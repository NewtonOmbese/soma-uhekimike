                    <p>Can books really open your mind, expand your knowledge, and transform the way you live?</p>

                    <p>YES! Three years ago, I stopped watching television and started devouring books. 100+ books later, I can confidently say it’s the best investment I’ve ever made.</p>

                    <p>Books have expanded my knowledge and opened my mind. They have allowed me to solve hard problems and uncover new interests. They have helped me excel in life and business. Above all else, books have brought me closer to a meaningful and fulfilling path.</p>
                    
                    <p>I recently re-read one of my favorite books, Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451. The novel is about a futuristic society in which people are banned from reading books. These people do not read, think independently, have meaningful conversations, or spend time in nature.</p>
                    
                    <em><b>“You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.” – Ray Bradbury</b></em>
                    
                    <p>Bradbury’s future is my nightmare, and it’s not that far off. If we continue to scroll our phones, wear Airpods as we walk around, and consume pointless news that makes us angry at each other and the world, we’re an inch away from living in Bradbury’s world.</p>
                    
                    <p>So how do we prevent this nightmare from becoming a reality?</p>
